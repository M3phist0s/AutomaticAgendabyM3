The story behind this Excel comes from a friend's request to optimize the new/past interns in her companiy fully automatically just by updating the dates. While having a nice graphical way to displaying it.

The first tab is the legend, so any category, department and so on you would like to identify with a different color. The color can be changed in the conditional formatting. If you want to change them, do so by changing the font and fill coloring for the cell for the top Cell. (Should be J5)

The second tab is the automatic calendar. To add a new line, just copy the full row and paste below or using insert copy row.

Finally rename the tab (in the blue square above to your convenience title), fill in column ACDE. G is the list defined in the first tab. Once the first tab about legend is properly field. You should see a drop down list option. 

Hoping this night help anyone out there. This excel is macro free on purpose.
